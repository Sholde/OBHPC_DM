Information
-----------

A Makefile is given to compile file.

Use `make` to compile and `make clean` to clean directory.

You can execute the program by typing : `./rdc [size] [output file]`

Note : Makefile clean the default output.txt file


Code explaination
-----------------

I use a structure to simplify code,
I always use 3 matrix and the integer which contain their size on all function where the structure is use, so it's for that.

All function are norlmally explicit.

Little information about my randoms function :
       - rand_sign : use for random 1 and -1
       - rand_double : use for random double, I pick 2 random integer and divide between them and after aply rand_sign

Errors
------

Error is handle by `if` statements whenever it is necessary to assume that functions are not bad uses.

Except compute function to don't stop process when the cpu compute the reduc/dotprod, so I use the trick that you show us, which is to call an function who compute after pointers are checks.

There are 2 error codes :
      - ERR_ARG : error of argument (i.e. : ./rdc 5, ther is not output file)
      - ERR_PTR : error of pointer (i.e. : the pointer is NULL)

Funtions
--------

	- print a matrix in a given file
	- init matrix with random value
	- release memory
	- compute function
	- randoms function
