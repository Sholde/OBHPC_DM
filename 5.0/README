Information
-----------

A Makefile is given to compile file.

Use `make` to compile and `make clean` to clean directory.

You can execute program by typing : `./lookup [size] [output file]`

Note : Makefile clean the default output.txt file


Code explaination
-----------------

I use a structure to simplify code,
I use always 3 matrix and the counter on all function, so it's for this.

All function are norlmally explicit.

Little information about my randoms function :
       - rand_sign : use for random 1 and -1
       - rand_double : use for random double, I pick 2 random integer and divide between us and after aply rand_sign

Error :

Error is hanfle by if statements whenever if necessary to assume that function is not bad uses.
Exept compute function to don't stop process when the cpu compute the reduc/dotprod.

Funtion :
	- print a matrix in given file
	- init matrix with random value
	- release memory
	- compute function
	- randoms function
